**Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Specification: Enhancing Fingerprint Biometric Template Security**

  Objective:
The MVP aims to demonstrate the core features of enhancing fingerprint biometric technology using AES and LSB algorithms. It focuses on providing a functional prototype with basic user interactions and security measures.

  Core Features:

1.   Fingerprint Data Encryption (AES):
   - The system allows users to upload their fingerprint biometric data.
   - Fingerprint data is encrypted using the AES encryption algorithm.
   
2.   Data Embedding (LSB):
   - The system embeds the encrypted fingerprint data into a selected cover image using the LSB algorithm.
   
3.   Stego-Image Generation:
   - The system generates a stego-image that combines the cover image with the embedded fingerprint data.

4.   Decryption and Extraction:
   - Users can provide the stego-image to the system.
   - The system decrypts the embedded fingerprint data from the stego-image using AES decryption.
   
5.   User Authentication:
   - The system uses the decrypted fingerprint data for user authentication.
   - If the fingerprint data matches the stored data, the user is granted access.

6.   User Interface (UI):
   - Develop a basic user interface for user interactions, including options for data encryption, decryption, and feedback submission.

7.   Documentation:
   - Create user guides explaining how to use the system.
   - Prepare documentation for developers if applicable.

8.   Basic Testing:
   - Conduct unit testing for encryption, decryption, and data embedding.
   - Perform integration testing to ensure seamless functionality.

9.   Security Measures:
   - Implement security measures to protect encryption keys and sensitive data.

  Use Cases:
1. User Encrypts Fingerprint Data
2. Embed Encrypted Data into Cover Image
3. Generate Stego-Image
4. User Decrypts Fingerprint Data
5. Authenticate User with Decrypted Data
6. User Provides Feedback
7. Error Handling - Invalid Input
8. Security Measures - Key Protection

  Technical Requirements:
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries and Frameworks: tkinter, Pillow PIL, Pycryptodome, opencv-python, cryptography, numpy, cffi
- Development Environment: Visual Studio Code
- Version Control: Git/GitHub
- Hardware: Any computer with over 250GB in ROM and 4GB RAM

  Data Model:

  Entities:
1. User
   - Attributes: User ID (Unique identifier), Username, Password (Hashed or securely stored), Fingerprint Data (Encrypted using AES)
   - Relationships: Each User can have one associated Stego-Image.

2. Stego-Image
   - Attributes: Image ID (Unique identifier), Image Data (Contains embedded fingerprint data), User ID (Foreign key to associate with the user)

  Development Plan:
- Follow the provided development plan with milestones for each phase, including setup, MVP development, testing, documentation, and deployment.

  Deployment and Scaling:
- Use a cloud hosting service (e.g., AWS, Azure) for deployment.
- Start with basic scaling and manual scaling as traffic increases.
- Implement a load balancer and backup for high availability.

  Marketing and Launch Strategy:
- Create a simple landing page with project information.
- Establish a social media presence.
- Build an email list for updates.
- Engage with online communities.
- Conduct a closed beta test.
- Host a virtual launch event.
