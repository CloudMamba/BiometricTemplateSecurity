To implement image-to-image steganography using AES cryptography in Python programming, we will need to use the following steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries, including PIL and tkinter.
2. Create a GUI interface using tkinter that includes input fields for the secret image, cover image, and AES key.
3. Load the secret and cover images using PIL.
4. Convert the images to pixel arrays and flatten them.
5. Pad the secret image if necessary to match the dimensions of the cover image.
6. Encrypt the flattened secret image using AES encryption and the provided AES key.
7. Convert the encrypted secret image back to an array of pixels.
8. Hide the encrypted secret image within the cover image by replacing the least significant bits of the cover image's pixels with the corresponding bits of the encrypted secret image.
9. Save the steganographic image as a new file.
